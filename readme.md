	The Task <br/>
	A non-empty CSV consisting of N integers and sorted in a non-decreasing order is given. The leader of this collection of values is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of the CSV.
	You should construct an PHP solution that allows a user to upload a CSV file consisting of N integers, sorted in a non-decreasing order, and then outputs the leader of the values. The site should return -1 if the collection does not contain a leader.
	For example, given CSV consisting of ten elements such that:
	2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6
	the result should return âˆ’1, because the value that occurs most frequently in the CSV, 2, occurs five times, and 5 is not more than half of 10.
	Given CSV consisting of five elements such that:
	1, 1, 1, 1, 50
	the result should return 1.
